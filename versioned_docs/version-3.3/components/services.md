Every process that is launched by CloudNet is called a service. It can be a Minecraft proxy or server. They consist of [tasks](tasks), but the task doesn't have to be permanent. So you can also create a new service without having to create a new permanent task.  
To create a service based on a permanent task, use the `create by TASK AMOUNT` [command](#), add `--start` to start the service directly.
